              Hello, I’m Devin Sloan, an entry-level Front-End Developer with a
              graphic design background. Born and raised in Orlando, FL, I enjoy
              origami, designing, and learning languages in my free time.
            </p>

            <p>
              My passion for technology began in 7th grade during an ICT 2 class,
              where I was introduced to HTML. Inspired, I taught myself basic web
              development through a YouTube video, which sparked my interest in
              pursuing a career in tech.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              In 2022, I considered enrolling in a Web Development program at
              Orange Technical College but chose the Digital Media/Multimedia
              Design program instead, which included web design. I graduated in
              2024, creating designs I’m proud of, some of which are featured in
              my physical portfolio and on Instagram. After graduation, I explored
              graphic design careers but realized my true passion lies in web
              development.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              I enrolled in Codecademy’s Front-End Engineer course, where the
              structured approach, quizzes, and guided projects have helped me
              improve rapidly. I am continuing my studies in Front-End Development
              and I am confident that Codecademy is helping me pave the way to
              becoming a successful Front-End Developer.
