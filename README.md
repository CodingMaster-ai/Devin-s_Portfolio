This is my Personal Portfolio Website, developed using Visual Studio Code. It features HTML and CSS for the layout, and JavaScript for interactive "Show Projects/Skills" buttons. Upon visiting the site, you'll encounter a login form where you must enter the correct credentials to access the main page. The form includes client-side validation, with the credentials hardcoded.

The homepage displays some of my top projects, showing the title, description, and a link to each project on hover. Below, you'll find the programming languages I've learned, along with the text editor I currently use.

In the top-right corner, there's an "About Me" link (or person icon on mobile) that directs you to a page with a short bio and my contact information. The header also includes a "Home" link (or house icon on mobile) that will take you back to the main page.
